# Dashboard with Plots and Machine Learning Predictions

This is a Streamlit application that displays several plots for different datasets, including the iris, wine, breast cancer, and titanic datasets. In addition to the plots, the application also includes machine learning predictions for the iris dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

2. Install the required libraries using the command:

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory where the repository is located and use the command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the application and open a new tab in your web browser. From there, you can select which dataset you want to view and interact with the plots and machine learning predictions.

## Datasets

The application includes the following datasets:

- **Iris**: A dataset of flower measurements with three different species.
- **Wine**: A dataset of chemical measurements for different wines with three different cultivars.
- **Breast Cancer**: A dataset of breast cancer diagnoses with two different classes (malignant and benign).
- **Titanic**: A dataset of passenger information for the Titanic with a binary target variable indicating whether the passenger survived or not.

## Plots

The application includes four different types of plots for each dataset:

- **Heatmap**: A heatmap of the correlations between the different variables in the dataset.
- **Histogram**: A histogram of the distribution of a single variable in the dataset.
- **Bar Plot**: A bar plot of the counts of different categories in the dataset.
- **Scatterplot**: A scatterplot of two variables in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Predictions

The application also includes a machine learning prediction for the iris dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier is trained on a portion of the iris dataset and then used to predict the species of a new flower based on its measurements.

## Conclusion

That's it! You should now be able to run the application and explore the different datasets and plots. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact me.
